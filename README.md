# REST API METHODS
Here we can Learn about the Rest API Examples on HTTP Methods :

`-GET : To retrieve an information from a server`

`-POST : To add an information in the server`

`-PUT :  To update an information in the server`

`-DELETE : To remove an information in the server`

# POINTS TO REMEBER -
1. examples which are hardcoded and used in fixtures won't work since it is already used in the specified url.
2. In framework project - you should generate your own access key ( "Authorzation" in Headers) I have used my own key.
